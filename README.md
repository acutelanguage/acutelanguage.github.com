# Acute website

The website isn't anything spectacular, but it serves its purpose: Present information, including documentation to the user.

## Contributing

If you want to make some changes, a few things to keep in mind.

 1. Make sure Ruby (>= v1.8) is installed.
 2. Install bundler (`gem install bundler`)
 3. Run `bundle install`
 4. Build the site HTML files by typing: `proton build`

(If #2 fails, you may need to type `sudo gem install bundler` instead.)
