          Acute is an object-oriented programming language based on prototypes. It is an implementation of
          <a href='http://www.iolanguage.com/'>Io</a>
          and aims to be entirely self-hosting. After all, any language worth its weight in NAND flash is self-hosting, isn't it?
        </p>
        <h3>Feature list, ready for it?</h3>
        <p>
          Here's a list of the features in Acute, more detail will be covered in the documentation. (Yes, I know there's no link there right now.)
          <ul>
            <li>Lightweight Object-Oriented language</li>
            <li>Bootstrapped in Ruby (later, LLVM IR)</li>
            <li>Enhanced lightweight object model (differs from Io, more powerful)</li>
            <li>Slots as first class citizens (known as Metas in Acute)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
